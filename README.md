# Movoda Quests
Just a list of quests for www.movoda.net

# Spelling Errors
Provided spelling is wrong in the quest it may be corrected

If it is dialect by the quest giver or player response to the quest giver it is not allowed to be change.

# Formatting
More information on how to format can be found here https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
To be determined more, below is a basic outline. Colors are not allowed, so need to figure out the best way to show quests.
* Cities should always be in Italic
* Items/NPCs/Enemies/Spells should always be bold
* Quest choices should always be un an unordered bullet list
* No images are allowed
* If a quest has multiple parts and is not considered multiple quests. Add a separator between quests, for example those found in The Journey, for quests that have additional parts, like Mining Help 01, and Mining Help 02, they should always contain a 0 and followed by the # of the quest part. This is also required for all Quests that contain a # at the end Such as The Journey Part 01, The Journey Part 02.
* NPC text ** Add Info **
* Quest Links should always be underlined
* Quest Log Header is Header 6
* Reward Header is Header 6
* Player Response
* Player Rewards
* Start Location and End Locations should be clearly marked at the top of the quest
* Quest name is to be listed at the very top of every Quest
* Requirements for a quest are to be listed clearly.
* Reminder to escape all special characters when using Markdown formatting.

# Notes
We do not want to direct players on what we think a player should do. We all know the saying about opinions. Therefore we only want facts listed on quests.
* Notes are not allowed
* No suggestions
* No comparing quests or rewards
# Quest ID and Names
We are looking for a list of all quests and their quest ids. This will help ensure we do not have duplicates, and know when a quest is 100% complete.
