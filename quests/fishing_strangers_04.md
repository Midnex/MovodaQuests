Hey! This voice... It comes with a rod stab, always...

Turn around

Dwarfy guy: "And guess who is that? Me, me, me.. Not crowned king of the lake! What brought you here? "

Well, I wanted to catch a few pikes for myself.

Dwarfy guy: "A few pikes? That's a deal ! First to 100 !!! " The dwarfy guy runs to the river as fast as he can.

Quest log: Catch 100 Pikes in Eptile.

Dwarfy guy: "Hrrrr... Stop doing it ! You hear me? Stop ! Stop ! Stooooop !!! I'm better fisherman, I'm better! "

Haha, I won!

I will have my revenge one day!!
