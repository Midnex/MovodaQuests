Hey! You have been stabbed by a rod. Turn around.

The same old dwarfy guy is standing there.
I am tired of you stabbing me with a rod ! Stop it !!!

*Sarcasm* Haha, crying king of the lake. that's Epic. Big girls don't cry, don't you remember?
I am not crying!

No need to shout, I can hear you. Care to race me?
Sorry for shouting, i just don't like people stabbing me with rods.

Oh that's the spirit! This time it will be more difficult. Heard anything about oysters? Those damn little things can slip out of your hands so quickly that you won't even notice ! Anyway, enough talks, first to catch 100 wins!
