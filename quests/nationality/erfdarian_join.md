###### These are notes, not a quest text, needs replaced, no notes allowed please.

Start:
    Bulbas
Requirements:
    Neutral Citizenship


Choice:
    Eptile for a fishing test
    Hikori for a woodcutting test
    Tropi for a trade test.

Notes: The woodcutting test is easy! Chop down 100 trees (admittedly, at 1 log per tree), and you get to keep the logs! That's it!

Notes: The trading quest is expensive! You get given a paltry amount of Vessi (300v), and have to find a piano, an aluminum quarterstaff, a wood card, a woodcutting necklace, an apple pie, and a tuba. The piano alone will set you back 2K or so.

Notes: The fishing quest? No idea - who would want to do anything but woodcut?
