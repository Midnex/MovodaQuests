### The Journey

#### needs work, and split out for Path of the Mind and Path of the Body. 
Starts:
    Ponat Pier

Requirements: 
    15 Magic
    25 Combat
    MIND only 10 Crafting

An old man is standing on the pier, staring over the water, with a peaceful expression on his face. As you walk past, he waves you closer.
Go closer

"I see someone unsure of their path, not clear about direction. It is better to take a lot of small steps in the right direction, than to take a great leap into the wrong, only to stumble backwards."
"What do you mean?"

"The path you choose will have a large effect on your life. I can help you with the journey, but you need to choose your path. There are two paths and both are equal."
Continue

"The first path is the path of harmony, inner peace and spiritual growth. It is the path of the mind. You will learn to become one with the weave, focus your inner self and learn the power of mana."
"Tell me more."

The second path is the path of the strength, focus of body and become one with the blade. It is the path of the warrior. You will become one with your weapon, focus your body and learn the power of the edge."
Wait for the man to finish

"The two paths are mutually exclusive, so choose carefully. You will be able to change your path, but refocussing on new goals takes time. Remember, small steps."
I choose the path of the mind
I choose the path of the body


PATH OF THE MIND

"Very well, meet me in Irotho so we can start your training.

The old monk is sitting in front of a dilapidated hut on a flat rock in the lotus position a foot or so from the ground. He opens his eyes and look at you as you approach.
Continue

"The path of the mind is one of focus. To have focus, one needs a sturdy staff, something just right for the road. To find the right staff, you will need to search for the right piece of wood."
"I see."

"Go to Rissdra and find the right piece of wood. Once you have cut a sufficient amount of wood, come back here."
Cut 500 logs at Rissdra, logs remaining: 500


Return to irotho with the 500 logs
"Good, you're back. Rotten logs cannot be carved. Go through these and select 100 good ones. Add the rest to the pile over there."
Sort the logs

"Now take these logs to Port Schow and craft yourself a great staff for the road."
Craft 1 great staff at Port Schow, staff remaining: 1
Note: there is a special crafting hut for this item - Great Staff Hut

You finally managed to craft the perfect staff.
You already have the perfect staff.

Return to Irotho and equip the staff:
You find the monk in his usual space, hovering above the stone. A piece of cloth and a bottle are sitting on the rock next to him.
Approach

He holds his hand out for the staff. "A good staff, but you are holding it wrong."
Give him the staff

He takes the cloth and then oils the wood, before handing it back to you. "The staff will be your partner while exploring the world. Remember, he who hurries, cannot walk with dignity. Spend some time, get to know the staff."
You got 1 Staff of the Apprentice




Requirements: Probably Magic level 20


"Welcome back my apprentice."

Continue

"A closed mind is like a closed book, just a block of wood. This piece of wood is better than most, but until you have added earth and air to it, it is not worth much."

Continue

"Go to Droesar, mine some copper and tin, then come back here."

Mine some tin in Droesar, tin remaining: 300
Mine some copper in Droesar, copper remaining: 300


"Rough as it is, the earth cannot be used. Molded it must be, purified true."

Continue

"Take some wood from that pile, smelt these into bars at Cardina and then return here."
You got 150 Logs

Smelt Bronze bars at Cardina, bars remaining: 150

"A bit of Bronze, attract the spark of the gods."
Continue

"Go to Awaru and find the small sacred smithy there. Smith this Bronze into rods, then meet me at the mountain of the gods and we will construct the path."

Smith Bronze Rods at Awaru then meet at Mt. Pharos, bars remaining: 30

"We need to construct a lightning conductor to the staff using the Bronze rods."
Continue

"There is a risk that the staff may not survive."
Build the lightning conductor with the monk

The monk takes a seat on a rock and looks up at the sky.
*wait*

After a while the sky clouds over and there is a brilliant flash. The lightning arcs to the rod and into the staff.
Continue

The monk picks up two blackened pieces of wood. "Failure is not falling down but failing to get up."
Continue

"A great fortune depends on luck, a small one on diligence. Go to Rissdra and cut 500 logs, then meet me at Irotho to continue."


The monk fetches the staff and hands it to you. "A great staff. The gods have blessed us today. Go forth, use your new staff. Once you have regained your focus with it, come see me to continue your training."
You got 1 Black Staff

##The Journey Mind Path Part 3

Probable requirements: Magic level 25, Black staff equipped at Irotho.


"Welcome back mage."
Continue

"The gem cannot be polished without friction nor man perfected without trials. Much have you learned and it is time to add some power to your staff."

Continue

"Bring one silver bar, 10 herbal teas, a crystal ball to meet me at Haldos."

Bring one silver bar, 10 herbal teas and a crystal ball to Haldos.



You find the monk standing next to Haldos when you arrive. "Have the items? Good."
Continue

"You need to purify yourself before the ritual. Join the circle and meditate a bit."

Meditate at Haldos, meditate remaining: 300


The monk examines you as you approach. "Better yes, you look ready now."
Continue


He hands all the items you brought to Haldos and Haldos places them on a table in front of him. Then adds your staff to them.
Continue

Haldos drinks the teas and motions for you to place your hands upon the staff. "I need you to assist me with the focus. Concentrate your energy on the staff."
Continue


Blue magic flows from his hands, enveloping the staff, silver bar and crystal ball. The silver flows over the ball and staff fusing the two together. Silver symbols appear on the blackened wood and a staff of power is born.
Continue

"My thanks brother." The old monk critically examines the staff before handing it to you. "Go forth and explore the world. Your hard work has paid off."
You got 1 Staff of Power

##PATH OF THE BODY


"Very well, meet me in Irotho so we can start your training."

The monk is moving slowly with precise movements, practicing a kata. He stops when you approach and bows. "Welcome my student. The art of the body is a tough one. You will need to practice hard to get the strength and accuracy to destroy your foe, without him hurting you too much.“ Continue

To complete this journey, you will fight many monsters, in many different places. From each you will learn and from each you will improve."

Continue

"First you will need speed, accuracy and defence. The best place for you to train this is the Dwarven Lands, containing the goblin hoard. Get your paperwork in order, use the staff and kill some goblins."

Continue

"Also bring back some Bronze Sabatons when you're done."


You got 1 Quarterstaff

Continue

The Journey Body Part 2
Welcome back warrior. I see you are ready to continue your training." Continue

"An important part of combat is not being hit. One needs to be quick and agile, ducking blows that come your way. Get your paperwork in order and go hunt some griffins and lizards at the mesa."

"Bring back some iron shortswords when you're done."

>Kill griffins at the mesa, griffins remaining: 100
>Kill lizardman at the mesa, lizards remaining: 1,000

The Journey – SWITCHING PATHS

The old monk draws a line in the sand, then clears it out, drawing another line 90 degrees to the previous one. He looks up at you.
"I need to change my path."

"All things change and we change with them. Are you sure you want to change your path? Remember, it will take time to regain your focus."
"Yes, I want to change my path."

"Very well, go practice your combat stances and meet me in Irotho once you have regained your focus."




-------
The Journey28 day delays:
These occur between (nearly) all the legs.
Exceptions:

* When switching paths, you normally have to wait 28 days before going to Ponat Pier and getting the text posted above by Skippy, then wait another 28 days before picking up the quest again in Irotho.

* If you fail to make a black staff, you will be immediately moved back onto the first mind path quest again, allowing you to make another apprentice staff - so you will have effectively just lost a month by failing (mind you, you could fail again the following month )

* After making the power staff (3rd mind path leg) there is *no* 28 day delay You can immediately make another apprentice staff, or go back to Ponat Pier and switch paths (waiting only one month), or, presumably, if you're high enough level, go straight on to the Archmage quest.

* On any path, after you've waited the 28 days between legs you do not have to do the next logical section - you should be able to do any section on your path, provided you have the correct staff equipped.
