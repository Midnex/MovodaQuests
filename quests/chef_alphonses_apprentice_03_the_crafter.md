-----
As you pass Chef Alphonse's kitchen you hear his angry voice, "What do you mean he did not deliver it? That Crafter is my best customer!" A young apprentice almost knocks you down as he comes racing out the door. "Oh thank goodness you are here! The Chef wants to see you immediately! Gotta run, I have an errand to perform. Bye!"

    Enter the kitchen.

-----
Though he is obviously angry, Chef Alphonse greets you warmly, "I am so glad you are here, I have a problem that maybe you can solve. My newest apprentice ran off with a delivery of pizza and now the order is late and my customer is furious. I should have known not to entrust such an important delivery to a new apprentice. Can you help me?"

    I will be happy to.

-----
Chef Alphonse smiles, "I knew I could count on you, this one is complicated and it has to be done fast and of course, up to our usual standard for freshness! All the ingredients are in our greenhouse as usual, so pick 100 wheat, 125 tomatoes, 50 green peppers, 50 mushrooms and 25 parsley. Grind the wheat into flour and cook the dough, sauce and pizza. Then deliver 25 pizzas to the crafters at Tropi.

As you approach the crafting hut a child runs up to you, looks at the bundle you are carrying and runs off yelling for their mum! A tired looking, middle aged woman comes out of the crafting hut and greets you, "Ah yes, Alphonse's apprentice, I hope those pizzas are fresh and not the ones that should have been delivered 2 days ago!"

    Give her the pizzas.

-----
"Oh, very nice! Thank you very much and tell Alphonse that he has redeemed himself with this delivery."

-----
Chef Alphonse sees you arriving and calls to you.

    Approach him.

-----
Chef Alphonse is waiting and you give him the crafter's message. A broad smile splits his face, "I knew I could count on you! Here is your pay and a special reward for doing such a fine job!"
