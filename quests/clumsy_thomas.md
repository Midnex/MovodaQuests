There don't seem to be any wood cards left on the ground.

Garando Mines:

"Ah I see you picked up most of the cards, care to give them back to me?" Yes sure, but how did you get this many Wood Cards?

"Well.. it's a long story but I don't have the time at the moment to explain. Just give those back and I will tell you later."

No, you won't get these back, at least not until you gave me a hint.

"Ok, one small hint.. It has something to do with the Museum. I found a way to get inside their archives!"

But..but..

"No time to talk, here take these cards maybe you or someone else needs them."
