Port Baron:

Strolling off the ship and down the main road of Port Baron a hooded man approaches you from the darkness of an allyway. Show him the note

Ah i see it is our mutual friends accomplice. He has been indisposed but said you would have a way of identifying yourself to me.

You see the hooded man lounging against a tree. Approach him

Ah well met again, unfortunately for security reasons I must make my own way up to the castle and prepare to let you enter.

Continue

Make sure you meet me in the crevice at the first bend in the valley.

Quest Log:

Meet the hooded man in the Valley of Cardina

Cardina Valley:

Walking round the first bend you see the crevice the man mentioned. Go over to it and squeeze in.

"This is your last chance to back out - if you don't want to do it - just say no now."

I want to kill this scum

"Good - you see that scullions entrance over there? I want you to go in disguised as a cook."

Continue

"From the kitchen you will be able to go through to the dining room and if his warriors challenge you - kill them and explore the castle."

Continue

"Find Dennech and kill him - bring us any plans he may have made."

Continue

You walk through the entrance and the stench of the kitchen hits you.

Continue in

Someone slams 20 raw bass into your arms - saying cook these and take 12 cooked through to the warriors in the dining room.
You got 20 Bass

Quest Log:

Cook 12 bass and take them through to the dining room in the castle hidden at Cardina Valley, Bass remaining:12

Cardina Valley:

You manage to find the path back into the castle. Enter

The chef shoves you through a large double door into a dining room populated by hungry warriors.

Walk in

The men holler you over to their table nearest to the door.

Approach the first table

You make your way round the dining room giving 2 bass to each table. As you reach the fourth table someone trips you.

Continue

All the men holler with laughter until you stand up and just punch one straight across the jaw

Continue

The men now realise you're not actually a chef but a warrior and they leap over the tables to attack you.

Quest Log:

Kill off those attacking you in the castle at Cardina Valley, enemies remaining:60

Cardina Valley:

Dead bodies mangled about you and strewn across the floor you wipe the sweat from your brow and head out of the door. Continue.

Heading out of the door you see an armoury dead ahead - and a gilt door to the side. You decide to check the armoury first.

Continue

Opening the door to the armoury you see rack upon rack of weapons and armour stacked up.

Walk in further and check it out

Seeing nothing you want here you put your head through the second door where the handle almost comes off.

Kick the door through.

Inside is who would look to be the Quarter-Master in his left hand you see a wickedly curved blade and you know you want it.

As you charge towards the Quarter-Master he spins and throws himself at you with unerring speed and accuracy. Fight

Remembering to pick up the weapon out of his left hand as you step over the body you press on into the castle
> You got 1 Cunovashi

Running down the corridor you turn a sharp 90 degree corner and run into a giant of a man in an open doorway. Fight

As you stand over the dead body of the man sweating and bleeding from many cuts you notice for the first time the weapon he was using
> You got 1 Varg

Quest Log:

I should find the old man and find the meaning of these plans

HE IS IN ... after 2 hrs of looking Baron Plains

Baron Plains:

After trudging for what feels like an eternity you finally find the old man cooking some magic fish on Baron Plains happily humming to himself. March up to him and demand to know the meaning of the papers

You ask him what the papers mean - instead of a response he upends a sack onto the ground full of cash and sparkly items

Take it

He says - before you take that I have a new combat technique to show you - also meet me here in baron plains when your stronger - we have another quest
