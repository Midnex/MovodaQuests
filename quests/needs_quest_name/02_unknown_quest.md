"That is a mighty fine weapon you have there friend. Where did you get it?"

"I bought it from a local guild store. "

"Oh, sorry, I mistook you for a smith."

"I am a smith!"

"Excellent!" As he speaks a group of battered,
hungry looking fellows begin emerging from the rocks around you, you count maybe 20.

"We are freedom fighters, seeking to overthrow the tyranical queen of Faldor.
As you can see, we are rather ill equipped and would be grateful for your help.
We would pay you what little we are able. Would you help us?"

"You seem like a decent lot, I'll do what I can."

"We've been digging bauxite for a while as well as some coal,
but we do not have the skill to smelt it.
You can begin by heading to Cardina and smelting our bauxite into aluminum bars
while I figure up exactly what we need. While you are in town,
coud you also trade this gem for about 400 meatloaves? We appreciate your help, friend."

"You are back at last! Did you get the meatloaf?" 'Give him the meatloaf'

"Thank you so much!" He hands the food off to an assistant who begins distributing
it among the men.

"Here is the list of armor and weapons we would like you to make;

After the fight you survey the carnage. "They aren't wearing any uniforms,
how do you know they

"My friend, do you really think the queen would be stupid enough to send troops
here wearing her colors?" He laughs, "Stick to smithing my friend,
leave the politics to us." All his men laugh heartily.
