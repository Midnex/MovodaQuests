### Pioneers 03 - Will You Help?

Req: Completed The second encounter Smithing level < 39 Combat level < 29
Starts: lake trand

Upon arriving at Lake Trand, Roger from the pioneers you helped
earlier walks up to greet you.
Greet him.


You remember him from the pioneers you helped previously.
He tells you that after the encounter with the Nagaromi,
he and his friends decided to settle in Mount Pharos,
but along the way they got lost and now the wheels of their wagon have broken.
"Would you mind getting us 8 wheels, 4 for the broken ones and 4 in case we need them?"

Sure, I'll get them. 
Leave me alone!

"Thank you very much, we'll wait here for you."

Do: Get 8 wagon wheels and bring them to the pioneers in Lake Trand.


After a few minutes, you find Roger and company where you left them.
Roger approaches you and is quick to ask, "Do you have the wheels?"

Give him the wheels.

Thanks old friend, we'll take it from here.

Continue

After a few minutes the wagon is ready to go again.
Roger walks up to you with his wife Rachel.
Would you mind escorting us to Mount Pharos so we don't get lost again?

Do: Escort the pioneers to Mount Pharos


After escorting the pioneers to Mount Pharos,
Roger walks up to you and asks if you could do them another favor.

Continue.

"Since this land is still rough, we can almost count on being attacked again.
We don't want you to fight all our battles for us,
but we know that you're pretty good at making things.
Would you mind making us some armor, nothing too fancy,
but something that could stop an arrow from piercing our hearts?"


What do you have in mind?
No, bugger off!


Here's a list I made while we were traveling, if you could make 10 of each of those,
along with the swords mentioned on the bottom,
we'll be in a good starting place to defend ourselves.

Take the list.

"Just return here to Mount Pharos when you're done making them, we'll be waiting."

Do: Smith 10 Steel Toed Boots, remaining: 10
Smith 10 Steel Helms, remaining: 10
Smith 10 Iron Platemail, remaining: 10
Smith 10 Iron Sabatons, remaining: 10
Smith 10 Iron Gauntlets, remaining: 10
Smith 10 Iron 2-Handed Swords, remaining: 10
After smithing the gear return to Roger and the pioneers at Mount Pharos with it.


You walk up to Roger and the pioneer camp with the gear.
Roger asks, "Is it all done?"

"Yes it is"

Wow!! That was quick, thanks for your time in this matter,
as you know, we don't have much to pay you back with, but here's what we do have.
