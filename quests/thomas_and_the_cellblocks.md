### Thomas and the Cellblocks

Requirements:
* Completed The cards museum.
* Cards Level 5

Ferboi:

The sign that says 'Cards museum' draws your attention. 'Enter the museum'

The area with the smithing cards looks restored after Thomas's last visit.

'Walk to the Animal cards department.'

The animal cards department looks nice as well, but you see a few empty spots.

'Look for the curator.'

You see a woman standing over a large desk. "My name is Yoinfa and I am curator of the animal cards department." In her hand you see a card you never seen before.

'Ask her about the card.'

"Well, I can't tell you much about the card or where I got it. This card is one of the rarest around."

'Ask about the missing animal cards.'

"Those missing cards are a mystery to me. They all disappeared a week after Thomas stole the other cards, we suspect he stole them too but we can't prove a thing."

"What cards are you missing?"

"Well we had a fox, deer, hawk and a grizzly bear card."

"Oh, that grizzly bear card is really hard to get."

"I am sure you will manage a way to find it, I will have a nice reward waiting for you if you get it!"

Quest Log:

Run to Garando mines to see if you can find Thomas.

Garando Mines:

The miners in the mine are just on a lunch break. This could be a good time to ask them about Thomas. 'Ask them if they know where Thomas is.'

"You are looking for Thomas, AGAIN? Haven't you heard the latest news?"

"What news?"

"Thomas was jailed by the dwarves and has been transported to the cellblocks in Naton."

"Why? What has happened?"

"Well you know he stole many cards from the museum. Last trick he tried to pull was to steal a big stash of Steel Cards from one of the Dwarven smiths."

"That's not too bright of him..."

"Yes, he figured that out by now too."

Quest Log:

Walk to the cellblocks in Naton.

Naton:

You see a dwarf sitting on a stone near the cell blocks. In his left hand you seen an empty bottle and in his right hand a dangerous looking axe. 'Approach him and ask about Thomas.'

"Thomas is behind bars in one of our cells, he won't be going anywhere soon!"

"Is it possible to speak to him briefly?"

"Well, it has been a while since I had something do drink, maybe a drink would help my mood!"

Quest Log:

Bring the gurad 2 bottles of rum.

"Nice rum! My tounge feels like a piece of leather right now, thank you. I will give you 5 minutes to speak to Thomas" "Thanks."

You walk past the cell blocks looking to find that card thief. There is a long line of cell blocks, some are filled with drunken dwarves, mad elves and an occasional faldorian citizen.

'Look for Thomas.'

In the back of a dark cell you see Thomas sleeping, loud snoring noises come from something that appears to be his bed.

'Throw a rock at Thomas to wake him up.'

"Hey hey hey!! Who is throwing rocks at me?"

'You look Thomas straight in the eyes.'

"Oh, it's you again. As you can see there I can't do much for you this time."

"Well, you could start by explaining where you left the animal cards from the museum."

"Ah, they finally discovered those cards are missing? It was quit a job stealing those, do you want to hear the story?"

"No thanks, I just want those cards back."

"Well that's a bit of a problem isn't it? I am kind of locked behind bars?"

"I am sure we can figure something out IF you give me your word."

"Ok, I'll give you my word. You will get the cards after you get me away from this cell."

"Give me some time and I'll get you out of here."

Leaving Thomas behind, you walk back to the dwarf that sat in front of the cellblocks.

The dwarf still sits on his rock, looking a bit tipsy to you.

Approach him

"Yar rumm was nice rumm, do yous have mowe of were tat came fwom?"

Quest Log:
Bring 4 bottles of rum and 2 meatloaf to the dwarf in Naton.

Naton:

"Taks kinde sir" Says the dwarf just before he attacks another bottle of rum. "It's my plea..."

Just before you finish your sentence the dwarf passes out and falls off his rock.

'Try to find his keys'

The keys are on the left side of the belt, they look rather easy to get.

'Get the keys'

With the keys in your hand you run as fast as you can to Thomas's cell.

"Hey, am I glad to see you! I am almost thought you forgot about me."

"Well I almost did, did you remember our deal?"

"Yes I did, open the cell and meet me in Garando Mines!"

Garando Mines:

"Outside the mines you see Thomas waiting nervously." "Did you get me the cards?"

"Well.. How shall I explain this? Someone must have known my hiding place.. most cards are missing!!"

"Is this some trick you try to pull?"

"No, it's not. Here is the Grizzly Bear Card I still have left, you will have to find the others yourself."
