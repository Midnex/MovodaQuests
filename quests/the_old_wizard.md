While traveling through the mines you smell a peculiar odor coming from a tunnel that until now you had never noticed. Investigate.

Wandering through the cave you find that it splits. One tunnel deads end quickly.

Well, then take the other tunnel.

You hear something from deeper within the cave

Keep moving deeper.

You see light reflecting off the cave's walls from what must be a fire around the next corner.

Draw your sword and charge around the corner.

You leap around the corner adrenaline pumping only to find an old elf in torn robes and a funny pointy hat sitting next to a fire chanting something

Interrupt his chanting.

"Wha!" the startled elf jumps and cowers into a corner as the fire extinguishes itself

Don't be alarmed old elf I'm only an adventurer.

You catch a faint whiff of the odd odor from before. "I am not here to harm you," you say. "But you...but...I..." he begins to stutter as you feel your hair stand on end and watch as the fire seemingly re-ignites itself.With the light you are better able to see him. His eyes dart around the room as if to absorb all information from the surrounding area. He leans forward with his eyes still glancing about. You feel slightly nauseated but strangely safe. "Not one of them? Then what are you?" he asks in a friendlier but hoarse voice.

"An adventurer", you say.

"Hmm." His eyes focus on you as he looks you over. "Being an adventurer," he begins "have you many traits?"

Well...

"I could use someone of your caliber." He interrupts. "What say you to a job adventurer?"

Of course.

"You will travel to Eptile and cut 400 logs from an isolated grove just by the river. Those woods are infested with the beetles though so you must be careful."

Ok....?

While you're there if you wouldn't mind returning with 100 beetle meat I'll throw in a little extra for your trouble.

Quest Log:
* Locate the grove of trees in Eptile, cut 400 logs, and bring them back to the elf at Uzlea, remaining:400
* OPTIONAL: Bring 100 Beetle Meat to the old elf with the chopped logs

12 exp per chop
While chopping at Eptile you WILL get attacked by beetles. Just a heads up.
You do NOT have to stop at 400 logs. I decided to fill my inventory and get some combat in along with it. 

You scan the hillside for the same cave as before but cannot find it. Leave.

As soon as you turn around you peer back over your shoulder to see the old elf grinning and staring at you. "Thank you much adventurer, let me get your reward. Did you get the beatle meat too?"

No, I didn't manage to.
I sure did!  picked this one

"Thank you very much! If I am in need of your skills again and I know I will I'll find you"

Continue

The man turns and slowly walks away. The wind blows and kicks dust into your eyes. You wipe your face and find that the wizard has disappeared.

* You got 4,500 Woodcutting experience
* You got 2 Magic Fish
* You got 1 Thinking Cap

Enjoy!
