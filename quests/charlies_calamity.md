In the distance you hear a small explosion 

    Investigate

Ahead of you there is a smouldering pile of rubble which could have once been a shed. Standing beside it is a tall man covered in soot who is scribbling furiously into a small notebook.

    Approach

"Just set them over there if you would, friend" he says without looking up. Muttering to himself he glances in your direction "and be a good fellow and put that fire out would you?"

    "What happened?"

"Hmm? Oh that is nothing, minor setback is all. Nothing to worry about! It's all part of the process. Can't have everything work first time now can we? Where is the fun in that?" The man puts away his notebook and looks at you for the first time. "Hrm, you don't happen to have any logs on you by any chance?"

    "Logs?"

"Yeah you know, big things, burn quite well, logs. Oh I'm sorry, didn't introduce myself. My name is Charlie and I'm an inventor you see, working on my top secret project!" he grins broadly. "I seem to have used up all the fuel though. Would you mind getting me some more?"

    "Sure, how many do you need?"

"Good question, I got the last lot from a travelling salesman who came up from Ashia but these logs seem to some hidden explosive properties. Would you mind nipping down to Jiroka and getting me some from there instead? 500 should do nicely and I'll pay you for your services"

    "No problem, I will bring you some logs"

"Oh that's great, and as an extra bonus I will show you what my latest project is once you get back! All top secret stuff you know but I can tell you can keep a secret" he says with a wink. "Now don't be too long!"

##### Quest Log:
> Chop 500 Logs in Jiroka and bring them back to Mt Pharos, logs remaining: 500

"Oh great you're back!" Charlie says with delight when he sees you. "I was about to give up on you and go get some myself." 

    Hand over the logs

"Now, a promise is a promise and I said I would tell you about my invention. It's what I'm going to call a steam powered auto mining device! Can you imagine that? No more swinging pickaxes in the dirt, this will do it for you!"

    "How does it work?"

"I can't be going into too many details but, you see that hut over there? I have one set up inside, just need the fuel you brought me so I can get it going and I will show you how it works. Just give me a couple of minutes and be prepared to be amazed!" He quickly picks up the logs and disappears into the hut.

    Wait for him to return

After a few minutes of listening to hammers banging, cogs turning and learning a few more curse words, Charlie pokes his head out of the door "Might want to step back a little, just to be on the safe side" he says before disappearing inside.

    Move further back

You begin to hear lots of strange sounds coming from the hut that seem to be getting louder by the second. Without warning the door to the hut flies open and Charlie runs out as fast as he can yelling "Take cover!" before diving behind a large rock.

    Find some cover

As the dust settles Charlie comes over to where you are cowering "Yep, must be the logs, far too much explosive content. That's the third machine this week those logs have managed to wreck."

    "I don't think it's the logs."

"What? Of course it's the logs, the machine is perfect!" he says indignantly. "In fact I'll prove it. Go get me some more fuel but make sure they come from Radom this time"

##### Quest Log:
> Chop 500 Logs in Radom Woods and bring them back to Mt. Pharos, logs remaining: 500

"Finally!" Charlie says as he sees you approach. "You know, for a woodcutter you're not very fast. No matter, you're here now. You did get them from Radom this time right?" 

    "Yes."

"Ok good. Don't want anything exploding this time because of faulty fuel. If you want to get ready in your usual position we can begin" he says pointing to the large rock.

    Take cover

Charlie disappears inside with the logs and the strange noise starts up again. You close your eyes just as Charlie flies over the rock and scrambles up beside you covering his head.

    Continue

The explosion seems louder than before if that is possible. Standing up you look over at the hut and see it completely demolished "Well," says Charlie dusting himself off "seems you managed to get faulty logs again. Want to try one last time?"

    "Ok, where from this time?"

Charlie looks thoughtful for a moment before replying "Could try that Ashia place again I suppose. Might need a few more this time since you destroyed my hut."

You notice that Charlie seems to have rebuilt his hut and has made a few additions to it. 

    Inspect it

As you inspect the newly built hut Charlie's head appears in the door way "Hello again! Would you care to see my latest experiment?"

    Ask what happened to the mining device

"That thing? Stupid idea, keeps exploding so I've decided to go back to my previous work."

    Hand over the logs

"Thank you friend, now this new invention will have everyone clambering at my door wanting it."

    "I have no idea what it is."

"That's because it's revolutionary!" he cries with excitement. "See, I wondered why no one built houses up here and then it hit me. There isn't anywhere big enough for a permanent house so why not build mobile ones! Surprised no one thought about it before really."

    "Mobile house?"

"Oh yes, it's quite clever really. Inside there is a lever and once you pull it the wheels drop down making it into a wagon. You can then drag it to where you want; pull the lever again to put the wheels away and presto! Your home is always with you."

    "Can you demonstrate?"

"Of course I can. It's why I was waiting for you actually. Hold on." Charlie disappears inside the hut and returns carrying one end of a rope. The other end presumably is tied to the lever "Ready?"

    "Yes, Ready."

With a grunt Charlie gives the rope a sharp yank. You watch as the wheels slip into place on the side of the hut and it begins rolling backwards down the slope towards the edge of the cliff.

    Continue

Charlie lets go of the rope and takes out his notebook and begins scribbling furiously as the hut begins to pick up momentum.

    "Should we do something?"

"Do something? What would you suggest?" he looks up as the house flies off the edge of the cliff. The sound of crashing and splintering wood can be heard for a few more minutes before everything goes quiet.

    Continue

"Needs some kind of braking system I think" mutters Charlie. "Oh right, your payment of course. Here take this with my thanks for all your hard work. If you're ever looking for an invention you know where to find me!"
