Haldos Outpost -

Walking past Haldos Outpost you see Haldos taking to a well dressed man. Go over to say hello.

Haldos looks up at you. "Hello again young miner, I see you have practised some of the spells, this is my friend Realm Geed, he is a jeweller" he says.

Look at Realm Geed.

Realm Geed speaks to you "I was just chatting to my friend Haldos here about hiring someone for some help I need. Would you be interested? "

Depends what you need....

"I'm looking into the quality of certain gems and ores" he says.

Sure I'll help then.

"Wonderful" he enthuses "I only need a small sample, say 1000 Duranium Ore and one of each gem you can get from that ore."
