### Highway Robbers

###### Start:
* Martral

###### Requirement:
* Large Wagon Equipped (Speed 40)

You spot a small building in the center of town with pictures nailed to the wall

View the pictures

Each of them has a face and a number on it. As you stare at the pictures a man exits the building carrying a hefty purse of coins followed by another man grinning from ear to ear.

Say hello

"Ah, hello there." It seems impossible but his grin widens. "I'm Nordaak. And you must be an adventurer?"

"I am. What is this place?"

"This is where people come to collect and offer bounties."

"What sort of bounties?"

"Only the trouble making ones of course. Would you be interested in some work?"

"I could always use some extra coins."

"Excellent. Come inside with me then."

Follow the man

He sits down at his plain desk and begins searching through drawers. After finding the right handful he throws them onto the desk and in a stern voice says, "These men need to be brought to justice. Dead or alive it doesn't matter. You must find all four if you want a reward."

"What have these men done?"

"They are highway robbers and prey on passing merchants and traveling adventurers like yourself. They are armed and dangerous. I advise you be extremely cautious when confronting these men."

"And where can I find them?"

"I honestly do not know. My advice would be to search areas that are heavily traveled."

"When should I start?"

"As soon as possible." He smiles and hands you the papers.

##### Martral
On your way to Nordaak's office you can't help but feel that you're being watched. You turn your head to see if you're being followed only to witness birds chirping merrily from a nearby tree. As you turn again toward the office you notice a hooded figure by its door that wasn't there before. Turn around and defend yourself.

You have killed the Thief and gained 60 combat experience

Now that was a tough fight.
You got 1 Thieves Dagger

Continue into the office

"Ah welcome back." He seems to have no idea what just happened by his doorstep. "Have you rid of the bandits?"

Explain what happened

"One attacked you just now? You must be shaken up a bit from it still. Please have a seat."

Stand

"I see. You must want your reward then." He opens a desk drawer and tosses a small pouch at you. "The bounty for the four robbers was 1,000 vessi each. Unfortunately I don't know who attacked you just now and cant pay you for a nameless man. I hope we can do business again."

###### Rewards:
> You got 4,000 vessi
> You got 4,000 character experience
