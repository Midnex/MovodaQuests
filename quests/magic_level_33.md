"Well take your pick from the spellbooks on the shelf there", he motions towards a small bookshelf loaded with ornate tomes, "and I'll go over it with you."

"Now that's a scary spell. You can use it while out hunting to practice but it's going to be most useful against other people. Might change your reputation a little", he looks you up and down.

"But perhaps you're the type who prefers that sort of reputation anyway. Well if you're sure let's begin. To start with this may seem very similar to your Shock spell, the difference is how you ground your target."

"With a little practice and targets that are close enough together, rather than stopping at the first target you can get your shock spell to continue on and hit multiple targets after the first one."

"In practice you'll find that it doesn't make any difference in hunting, you can't get most monsters to line up nicely enough to jump the charge between them, but once you start using it against groups of humans that's another story."

"You may only be able to manage a few hops to start but with practice you should be able to hit quite a few targets with the same spell. Of course it can be defended against the same as your shock spell, but even if you hit someone with plenty of defense you have a chance of bouncing on to a more suitable target."

"And that should be all you need to know, if you upset the wrong people using it tell them Haldos taught you and leave me out of it."
You learned the spell "Chain Lightning"
