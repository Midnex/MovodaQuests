"Welcome to a new school year class. My name is Mr. Estman. Please sit down." Sit down.

"Now that we are all settled I will outline the main part of the curriculum for this year. We have a class project, I have been asked to supply a market stand and a few items for a local fishing town market." says Mr. Estman.

Listen.

"To that end, I require each of you to craft some items. These must be done individually, and I will be checking to see that nobody cheats" continues Mr. Estman. "There are two choices, and it's to be a blind choice."

Continue to listen.

"I have this choice, I call it Option A." Mr. Estman holds up a red piece of paper in his right hand. "And this choice, I call it Option B," Mr. Estman holds up a blue piece of paper in his left hand. "Now form an orderly queue, and choose which you want."

Stand up, and form a queue.

As you reach the front of the queue, Mr. Estman smiles at you and offers both pieces of paper.

Choose the red one.
Choose the blue one. **(I chose blue)**

Blue form:

You turn the blue piece of paper over.

Start to read.

The list is quite short. "Craft 5 small stands, 100 shark lures, 100 tuna lures, 10 rings of the fish, 10 fur coats and 50 fishing rods."

You finish reading and look up at Mr. Estman.

Mr. Estman wait for everyone to finish reading. "Now you have a further choice. You can either look through the cupboard at the back of the room for materials.."

Turn around and look at the cupboard.

"..or you may source you own materials. Please decide now which you wish to do."

Decide to source own materials. ** (I chose this) **
Decide to look in the cupboard.

"Good luck with the assignment then. I hope to see you in the fishing village soon."

"Finally! I was beginning to this you would never turn up! Let me check your work" says Mr Estman.

Let Mr. Estman check your work.

"Very good, now leave the items here and I will set the stands up. Meet me back at school later" finishes Mr. Estman. He turns away and starts setting the stands up.

"Well, congratulations, that went very well. All the items were well received, and all sold. That ends your assignment for this year. Go and practice your crafting skills, the next class will be more difficult. I hope to see you all there" Mr Estman finishes his goodbyes, and leaves the classroom.

**I must have chose the red as my list is less as long**


**might be good to put that in your guild forum that the red is a smaller list. I guess I am choosing to source it myself, curious if anyone got from the cupboard but oh well will go to it then thanks so much**


**instead of 100 it was 50 let me get out of forums here brb**

The list is quite short. "Craft 10 small stands, 50 shark lures, 50 tuna lures, 10 rings of the fish, 10 fur coats and 25 fishing rods."

As you reach the front of the queue, Mr. Estman smiles at you and offers both pieces of paper.

Decide to source own materials.
Decide to look in the cupboard. **(I chose the cupboard)**

Mr. Estman walks towards the cupboard and unlocks it. He peers in "Hmm, seems we don't have that good a selection of materials, looks like you have two choices only, which would you like? Box A? or Box B?"

Choose Box A. **(I chose Box A)**
