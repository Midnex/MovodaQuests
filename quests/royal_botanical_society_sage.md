### Royal Botanical Society - Sage

Walking through the busy streets of Pt. Baron, you notice a sign outside the new Faldorian greenhouse. Royal Botanical Society Now Offering Classes! Learn advanced planting techniques and help domesticate new plants! Classes open for all nationalities for a nominal fee. This looks interesting. I should go investigate.

You enter the building adjacent to the greenhouse itself. It's a good, sturdy stone construction, pretty good for Faldorian work. The short hallway lets out onto a reception area where a slightly confused looking old man sits behind a massive oak desk.

"Yes? Can I help you?"

I'm here to ask about the classes being offered.

"Ah, yes. Let's see. I have one available for Odtoni citizens...Sage is the subject, and it's taught by Squire Leonard. Registration fee of 100 vessi. Huh. He's actually on the grounds today if you are interested."

"Please sign me up. Here's the money."

The clerk takes your money and, at your insistence, gives you a receipt. He then directs you to walk around to the back of the greenhouse to talk to Squire Leonard.

Quest Log: Find Leonard outside at the greenhouses

As you come out onto the back lawns, you find the area being prepared by workmen. It looks like an expansion to the existing greenhouse. Squire Leonard is there also, interacting with the construction crews and having an intense conversation with an older, distinguished man whose fluffy white hair and wide eyes gives him the air of a barn owl. Walk up to them.

"...and we'll be able to grow the first couple crops of sage, garlic and black pepper here once the ground is prepared? Excellent work, Leonard."

Continue

"Yes, once the Annex is built, and we get a steady supply of the bonemeal. Before that it's impossible to put the main house under production with any of these."

Continue

"Yes, yes. Of course. Not to get ahead of ourselves...Oh! I'm sorry. Can we help you? Are you the new glazier?"

"Um, no. I'm here for the course on Sage. I just signed up."

"That's just wonderful! I am Jacob Hendrik, Master of the Royal Botanical Society and this greenhouse..."

Continue

"Only because I didn't want it." mutters Squire Leonard, causing Master Hendrik to blush.

Continue

"Err...Yes. Quite. Quite so. Anyway, Squire, if you could sign off on this..." He squints at his paperwork, patting down his vest helplessly. "Where are my blasted spectacles? I can't make a thing out without them. Old age, don't you know... Wherever..."

Continue

"Perhaps you left them back in the office? Why don't you go look for them and I'll talk with my newest student here..."

Continue

"Right. I'm off. Don't leave without signing these though." He hands the Squire the stack of forms and moves off.

"OK, teach me about sage."

"The first step is to gather materials for the annex...Oh don't look at me like that. This benefits everyone involved. I'll even let you determine the size of the annex if you'd like. The minimum we need for the experimental houses is 100 glass and 500 lumber. If you'd like, we could double that to 200 glass and 1000 lumber. Remember, the larger the greenhouse, the faster the learning process. And, of course, the more status the teacher will have." He smiles cagily. "We can't start without materials, so..."

I'm sure I can help...

"Very good! OK, let's sign these papers..." He takes out a set of spectacles and sets them awkwardly on his nose. He tries to read the paper only to flinch back in pain. "Gah!"

I didn't know you wore spectacles.

"I don't. Bah! I thought these things made this easier. I don't see what that old codger sees in them. They only give me a headache." He hands you the spectacles and the stack of forms.

Continue

"Would you please bring these back to Master Hendrik? I have to go consult the workmen."

Quest Log: Find Hendrik in his office in Port Baron.

"Oh, where have they gotten to? I thought...Ah! Its yourself. I still haven't found...Oh! You found my spectacles! Excellent! And the form...Yes, Ah! Thank you so much for pledging this optional donation of resources. We had only planned out a test bed that would need 100 glass to start." Continue

"With this we can build much bigger! Oh, wait until I tell my colleagues. And I'll have to tell the workmen! They were going to start with the materials we've collected so far, but they'll have to alter plans..."

"Materials you have now?"

"Oh yes. We had the supplies to start the smaller house. But now... Thank you so much!"

"Uh, sure, no problem. I'll get right on it. Again." Grumble

"Drop off the materials here when you have them. "

Quest Log: Return to Port Baron with 200 glass and 1000 lumber

"Ah, it's you. Just place that over there if you would." Squire Leonard indicates a place where a lot of materials are stacked already. "So, now I have to start building, right?"

"Well, no, actually. I had thought to tell you about sage; Salvia Officinalis to be precise. What I have to say will be very important to you. Is this a good time?"

"Tell me."

"Salvia Officianlis, or sage, is a common herb known among the Nagaromi. The tribe uses it as an element in purification rituals. It is said the scent of it drives away bad spirits and draws in good spirits. It is smoked, used in bundles and, most importantly, used as a savory spice to flavor soups, fish, and lamb dishes."

Continue

"It has been remarked on by the Nagaromi, and those who have eaten these dishes, that the sage provides a feeling of calm, of balance, quiet of spirit and serenity and tranquillity of being. It is a quality that is exploited by the Nagaromi in peace meetings and negotiations, as it makes the participants less willing to fight and argue."

Continue

"Sage itself likes a sweet soil. Too much richness of soil, like leaf mulch and decaying matter, will stunt its growth and reduce its potency. To this end, sage must be planted with white material, like ground bone or lime."

Continue

"The harvest, likewise, has its own intricacies. Only the Nagaromi know how to take it in while retaining its full efficacy. And it is to them that we must travel to learn more."

"What?"

"And here you must make a choice. I will help you learn, but this can take two forms. We can do this the long, hard way or the short, fast way. Both have their toll. If you wish to do this the long hard way, you will need to bring a Nagaromi spear and shield with you to Barin Plains. If not then you will need 5,000 vessi, a Corkscrew Card you might have been given by me, and will take an oath of silence. Which path will you take?

"I don't have the card, so I will take the basic path." I chose this
"I have the Corkscrew Card and I'm not worried about the oath of silence."

"Ok, meet me at Barin Plains, so we can continue your training."

Quest Log: Meet Leonard at Barin plains with a Nagaromi spear and shield

You walk across the plain and spot Squire Leonard sitting on a boulder, waiting for you. "So, did you bring what I asked for? Here, give it to me..." Give him spear and shield

"Now, we just have to wait around for a Nagaromi to wander by. Shouldn't take too long I'd say, and then we need to start arguing about who is a better harvester of sage, you or a Nagaromi."

It would be the Nagaromi, I should think.

"Well, yes, but the Nagaromi don't know that you see. So you are going to convince them that it may be so."

"To what end?"

"Its a ruse, you see. I want to trick them into teaching us."

"Oh! So we're going to lie!"

"Err...Yes, that's the general idea, yes. Ah, here we go. Let's start. *ahem* And I still say the Nagaromi make much better Sage harvesters than you!"

"Preposterous! I can out-harvest the best Nagaromi."

The Nagaromi comes closer, hearing the conversation and raises his weapon to the ready. "Here, you! Scout! Perhaps you could help me convince this person that he is nowhere near as skilled at harvesting sage as a Nagaromi."

Continue

The scout blinks in confusion, his weapon lowering slightly. "What mockery is this? Is this a new ritual to go through before your kind hunt us for sport?"

Let Squire Leonard do the talking.

"Well, as for me, I have killed Nagaromi, but never at the hunt. I was a soldier in the Queen's army, and while I admit to swinging a sword for the sake of a bit of a girl with hair like flame, I never took pleasure in useless slaughter."

Continue

The scout looks hard at the Squire, then nods in what might be respect. His weapon drops a little.

Continue

"Even as you say. And yet, why should I help with your contest? What reason do I have to trust you?" Squire Leonard tosses him the spear you gave him.

Continue

"I had wished to return this to the Nagaromi people. I won it at great expense from a braggart in Port Barin who wanted a fight more than gold. Let me return it to you as a sign of trust."

Break out coughing to cover your shock.

Squire Leonard turns towards you and quirks his eyebrow in annoyance. "You should have that looked at. Its unhealthy."

Continue

"Also, we will compete for this." The Squire says, holding up the shield you have him. "If you can't beat someone like this," here he nods at you. "I'd be surprised, so I have no trouble wagering this gift an old friend left to me."

Continue

"If it is to be won, I, Longspear will win it! Where is this picking race to be held?"

Continue

"Now, that's the thing. We have a contest but no sage. We're looking for it now and can't begin until..." Leonard trails off.

Continue

"Then we have no problem at all. I will lead you to a fine patch of sage, and he will harvest one half, and I the other and when we compare our harvest, I will take the shield away." Longspear boasts.

Continue

"Lead on then!"

Follow after Longspear and the Squire

The Squire drops back to whisper to you."When you begin, just watch what he does and mimic him. You're not here to win, just to learn. The corkscrew is working for you, not against you, this time."

"Understood"

Longspear leads you to a patch of Plains covered in Sage plants. "Here." he says, marking a line dividing the growth. "You take all to the left and I all to the right. When you're done, we will compare harvests."

Quest Log: Harvest sage in the sage patch, sage remaining:500

Now that the harvesting is done, you can see that Longspear's harvest is far larger than your own, but with what you've learned from him, it wouldn't be hard to match his achievement should you try again. Continue

Missing 1 line of quest text, guy just hands the dude a shield 


"Thank you my friend. Good travels." The Nagaromi picks up the spear and shield and trots off.

Continue

Leonard turns back to you. "Ok, I'll take the sage, we're going to need that as seed. Keep 100 for your trouble. Keep an eye open, you may find more next to the road in your travels. Check in at the academy from time to time. Soon you should be able to learn how to plant sage."

You got 7,500 Harvesting experience
