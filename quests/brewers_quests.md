### Brewer's Quest
Requirements:
# Starts Port Barin
# Chef apron equippe
# Level 39 cooking


Strolling through town you come across a broken down and disused old building. It has no windows and the chimneys on top are in poor disrepair. The huge metal vats outside however seem brand spanking new. There is an old-ish looking fellow with large muscle bound arms standing beside the door. Go over.

The man notices your apron as you approach and asks: "Interested in joining me in an enterprise to fix up this old building? I could teach you some new cooking methods as a reward!"

Agree


The man explains that he can fix the building, but has lost his recipe list of how to create his drinks, and that is what he needs. He tells you he had given it to his brother in Galawi to look after, and he asks you to retrieve this whilst he fixes the place up.


Galawi

You find the house of the brother who has the drink recipe list Knock on the door


After knocking rapidly a burly man answers. When asked about the recipe list he said he had traded it to Kimber in Cythe for 500 logs pointing at a stack of firewood nearby.


Cythe

You find Kimbers's house Knock on the door


Knocking on Kimber's tree-door he answers and tells you that he has the list indeed, but he will only trade it if you get someone to sharpen his new woodcutting axe for him. He points you to a dwarf in Sepas.


Sepas

You find a dwarf sharpening axes on a tree stump Ask about Kimber's axe.

He says that he would if only he had a lovely apple pie from the kitchen of the royal household of Faldor.


Echtin

You walk around and find the kitchen at the palace. Ask about an apple pie

The kitchen staff answers that the only thing apple pies are swapped for is a bunch of tightly wrapped lavender in special wrappings from the natives at Jiroka.


Jiroka

Approaching the centre of the woods you're actually aware of the natives milling around you. Ask for the lavender.


Reaching the middle of the forest you find your self in a small clearing, and you ask the shaman for a small bunch of lavender. The reply comes that he will trade it against a fishing rod from one of the fishers from Ponat Pier.


Ponat pier

Walking on to the end of the pier you see the fisherman that the native was talking about. Ask if you can have one of his fishing rods.


He says you could if you can convince his brother to come home. He has last been seen at the top of Mount Pharos.


Mount Pharos

As you come closer to the top of the mountain you see the brother on top of what appears to be the corpse of a baby dragon. As you come him you see the corpse is of a creature at least three times the size of a baby dragon. Tell him the story.


Laughing at your story, he asks you if you could go to Ferboi to tell his mother that he killed the dragon! In exchange, he will make sure recipe list will be returned to Galawi.


Ferboi

You find the man's mother where he said she would be. Tell her about his exploits.


Spluttering she asks you if this was truthful, and you say it was. A smile grows across her face and she pats you on the arm. Turning to leave you hear a rustle, you look around and the old lady had vanished.


Galawi

You find the brother's house again. Knock on the door.

He greets you with a smile and gives you the recipe list. He tells you to put it to good use.


Port Barin

You find the man back outside the building just finishing repairs. Show him the list.


He tells you it took a while to fix it up but he wants to know where you have been. When you tell him your story he asks if you are sure you haven't already made something on the list.

Continue

Regardless he says, you have held up your end of the bargain and so will I. You will not be able to cook in this building as I have bigger plans for it, but I believe there is a place in Irotho you can use!
