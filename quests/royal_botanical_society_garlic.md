Start: Port Baron

Prerequisites:

Next to the entrance of the greenhouse in Port Baron, you notice a sign. Continue

It reads: Royal Botanical Society Now Offering Classes! Learn advanced harvesting and planting techniques and help domesticate new plants! Classes open for all nationalities for a nominal fee.

Investigate

You find a sturdy stone building, a bronze plaque on the wall proclaims it to be the Royal Horticultural Society Academy. You find an old man sitting behind a large oak desk. "Can I help you?"

" I want to find out about the classes the academy offers."

"You look to be Faldorian." He shrugs. "Good luck, that crazy red headed dwarf left here in a huff. Said he's going back to Naton."

[QL] Locate the dwarf in Naton

After asking around, someone directs you to a square stone building with glass windows. On the patio, a tattooed, red bearded dwarf is rapidly pacing back and forth. Approach him

"...been offered sage and now having to do stinking garlic. By Grond's beard." The dwarf glares at you. "What!?!"

"I hear you are the tutor for Faldorians..."

"Like hell I am!." The dwarf swells two sizes and veins pop out on his forehead. "That bloody Leonard..." The dwarf grumbles.

"So, you're not the tutor."

"I suppose I am. I'm still contracted by that blasted Corkscrew Company and the penalties will ruin me if I don't." He shakes his head disgustedly. "Meet me in Port Baron and pay your tuition. Don't forget the receipt."

[QL] Pay for the course

You arrive back at the academy, to find the old man behind the desk. "I'm here to pay the fee."

"That will be 100v." He takes the vessi from you and hands you a receipt. "I think the dwarf is outside at the greenhouse."

[QL] Find the dwarf outside

You find the old dwarf outside talking to a older, distinguished man whose fluffy white hair and wide eyes gives him the air of a barn owl. "I said I want a larger greenhouse, this is going to be barely big enough for a test bed!" Wait

Hendrik nods rapidly. "The squire procured more materials, which is why we're able to make him a larger one. If you get more materials..." The dwarf's eyes pop out. "Dang blast it! That dog eared, red skinned..." He trails off as he notices you. "Did you pay your fees?"

Show him the receipt

"Good. Do you have a Corkscrew Trading Company card?" The dwarf face puckers up like he bit into a lemon.

"No, I'm sorry"  This is the option I chose
"Yes, I do"

"Well, it's not the end of it. You just need to go help out in the queen's greenhouses for a bit. Go to Echtin and find the gardener there. He will have something for you to do. Get a Form A from him when you done and bring it here."

[QL] Help out in the Queen's greenhouses in Echtin

You find the head gardener in the greenhouse where he is instructing a few helpers. He turns when he notices you. "You one of them students?" He arches his eyebrows. "Yes, I am"

He motions you over. "Well, don't just stand there. These here berries won't harvest themselves you know." He pushes a basket into your hands and indicates a nearby greenhouse. "Fill that basket with red berries, then bring it back here."

"Ok."

He turns back to the assistants and continue his explanation

[QL] Harvest Red Berry in the greenhouse, berries remaining:500

You notice the gardener where he is still instruction a few helpers Go over to him

He takes the basket from you. "Nice and full yes."

"The dwarf mentioned a Form A?"

"Yes, yes, here it is. You can take it back to him."

[QL] Return the Form A to the dwarf

You find the dwarf in the greenhouse right at the end. He takes the paper from you and motions you over to the plants in little containers on the ground. "So this is it?"

He nods. "These thin leaved bulb plants are deceptively tricky to harvest and grow. You need to be able to judge from the leaves above to know when the bulb is ready to be harvested."

Continue

"Take these beds here and carefully harvest the garlic from the soil below. Clip the leaves like this and then place them in the basket. Finish these beds and bring the basket to me when you're done.

[QL] Harvest Garlic in the greenhouse, garlic remaining:1,000

The dwarf takes the basket from you. "Well done. Now we have seed to continue our research." He tips half the garlic into a barrel next to the greenhouse, then hands the rest back to you.

Continue

"Hold on to these. You will need them later when we manage to get fertilizer to plant them. Keep your eyes open, you may notice more of these little buggers next to the road."
