"You here to buy my apples again?" says a cheery voice from somewhere in the bushes nearby. Ethel appears from the undergrowth covered in leaves with a basket of apples under one arm. "Oh I'm sorry, I thought you were that nice young man come to buy my apples again. I'm going to be rich!" she says with delight.

Rich?

"Yes! Rich! Some nice young man came round a few days ago and offered to buy all my apples. Can you imagine that? People paying good vessi for apples? I'm to get 5 whole Vessi for each basket I fill for him. A few years of back breaking labour and I can retire" she says happily.

Tell her she's being robbed.
Good luck with that!

"Robbed? Don't be silly, no one would rob someone like me. People are always kind and generous and...Erm...robbed you say? You really think so?" she says shuffling her feet and removing a stray leaf from her hair. "I'm not sure I like the idea of being ripped off, could you do me a favour?"

Sure.

My niece Linda lives over in Uzlea and she knows about these sorts of things. Could you ask her if I'm getting paid enough for them? In fact, I'll write her a note if you don't mind delivering it for me." Without waiting for a reply she pulls out some paper and a pencil from her pocket and hastily scribbles a quick note before handing it to you. "Don't be long mind, that gentleman will be back shortly asking for his apples."

Visit Ethel's niece Linda in Uzlea and deliver the note.

Following the directions given to you by Ethel you come upon a picturesque grape plantation. A small uneven road leads up to a small but homely house on top of a hill overlooking the plantation. Approach the house.

As you come close to the house a pretty young woman comes out of the front door to greet you.

Show her the note.

"Aunty Ethel still fighting with those apples at her age I see? I need to send her a reply but I don't really have the time! There is the east vineyard to be picked. They are off to be made into wine for some feast and my hired help has taken off ill. I have to pick this whole vineyard by myself today. Then there is the barrelling, loading into the carts, finding someone to..."

Offer to help.


"You will help? Oh that's wonderful! If you wouldn't mind clearing the east Vineyard. I can get on with my other chores and write a reply to Aunty Ethel" she smiles at you gratefully. "There should be some baskets next to the vineyard. Please do what you can and I will be right back".

###### Quest Log:
> Pick 350 Grapes from Linda's Vineyard in Uzlea. Grapes Remaining: 350

You fill the final basket with grapes and take them up to the house. Look for Linda.


Linda appears to be running around doing 10 things at once. You finally manage to catch her attention.

Give her the baskets.


"Oh what a wonderful person you are. I didn't know how I was going to get all these chores finished today. Good job you showed up when you did!" she says taking the baskets from you. "I finished the letter to Aunty Ethel if you wouldn't mind taking it to her. Oh! I almost forgot, here is a thank you from me for all your hard work.

Take the note.

###### Reward:
> You fold the note up, and put it safely away.

###### Quest Log:
> Take the note from Linda back to Ethel in Hikori.

Approaching Ethel's orchard things seem quieter than usual. It's almost too quiet. Look for Ethel.

You suddenly find yourself lying on your back looking up at the sky, a dull throbbing in the base of your skull. The face of Ethel appears above you waving a very large stick. Come back for more have you? I'll teach you riff-raff not to mess with little old ladies she says raising the stick for another swing.

    Ask her what happened.
Run for your life.

Oh don't act all innocent with me she yells angrily. First you show up saying you will buy my apples and when I refuse they suddenly get stolen! The entire crop gone! How could you! You quickly get back on your feet as she takes a half hearted swing at you.

Tell her it wasn't you.

Actually, now that you mention it you do look different. Slowly she lowers the stick and peers at you closely. Have I seen you before, you do look a little familiar.

Hand her the note.

From Linda you say? She carefully opens the note and reads it, her lips moving silently with each word. She folds up the note and places it somewhere inside her apron and looks at you quizzically. How did you know I had a niece over in Uzlea? Oh I don't suppose it matters anymore now that I'm ruined she says as a large tear appears in her eye.

Ask her how you can help.

Well I don't have any seed to replant my orchard but old Jed over at the market owes me a few favours. If you wouldn't mind asking him if I could borrow some apple seeds I would be very grateful to you. He's over in Port Barin.

I'll be right back

"I'll wait for you here" Ethel says, lifting her stick once again.

---
###### Quest Log:
Ask old Jed in Port Barin for some planting stock to get Ethel back in business.

You find your way to old Jed's stall just as he is packing up for the day. He looks up at you and sighs loudly. Tell him about Ethel.

"That's terrible!" he says after hearing your story. "I would love to help you out but I'm pretty much all sold out. Only thing I have left is this here Cilantro. It's not much but it should at least get her back on her feet" he continues, handing you a bag. "Tell her I'll come see her in a couple of days." He turns away and continues packing up his stall for the day.
###### Reward:
> You got 400 Bunch of Cilantro

---
###### Quest Log:
> Bring the 400 Cilantro back to Ethel.

As you arrive at Ethel's Orchard you see a note attached to her front door. Read the note.

In badly scrawled lettering you can just make out the words "Gone to Linda's back soon". Looking at the bag of seeds it seems as though you have nothing else to do but plant them

---
###### Quest Log: 
> Plant 400 Cilantro for Ethel. Number remaining: 400

Planting the last seed you look up and see Ethel walking towards you. Wave to her.

You dust yourself off as Ethel walks towards you scowling. Those are the strangest things I have ever seen she says pointing at the newly planted field.

Tell her about the cilantro.

Well I hope you realise I'm not going to pick those, you will just have to come back when they are grown and get rid of them she says with a huff before stomping off back to her house muttering to herself about the youth of today.

###### Reward:
> You got 5,000 Harvesting experience
